    What is a Would You Rather Generator?
   </h2>
<p>
    Alright, you ever play those “would you rather” games? You know—Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck? Classic. A Would You Rather Generator is basically your personal question machine that spits out fun, weird, awkward, or downright impossible choices. Great for parties, icebreakers, or just wasting time with friends when nobody feels like doing anything productive. It’s the digital version of “let’s make everyone uncomfortable in the most entertaining way possible.”

<h2>
    FAQs
   </h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
      Can I choose categories like funny or serious?
     </strong>
     Some versions let you filter, but the default is a mix of everything—from hilarious to kinda deep.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>
      Are the questions appropriate for kids?
     </strong>
     It depends—some are family-friendly, some are more teen-and-up. Use with caution around grandma.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>
      Can I share the questions with friends?
     </strong>
     Absolutely. Screenshot it, copy/paste it, or just read it aloud and watch the chaos unfold.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>
      Does it repeat questions a lot?
     </strong>
     Not really. There’s a big ol’ list in the background, so you’ll get new stuff pretty often.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>
      Can I submit my own would-you-rathers?
     </strong>
     That’d be awesome. While this version doesn’t allow it yet, who knows? Feature idea unlocked.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There you go—your go-to tool for getting people talking, laughing, and probably arguing (in a fun way). Want a themed version, like “Would You Rather: Horror Edition” or “Office Shenanigans”? I got you.
